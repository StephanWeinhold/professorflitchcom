Professor Flitch is not a professor. Neither at day nor at night. Professor Flitch is a band. That happens to have only one member. Now one could argue that artist is the more appropriate term here. But the Professor insists that they… erm… he is a band. Guitars, bass, drums, synths. No vocals. Professor Flitch is making music. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, always full of life. And hope. And kicking clouds, favorite places, childhood memories, good times. Maybe music is an understatement here. Professor Flitch is painting landscapes. Never trying to fit into an algorithm. Always trying to fit into your heart.
