## Legal & Data Protection

Declaration on the obligation to provide information (data protection declaration)  
The protection of your personal data is particularly important to us. For this reason, we only store your data with our German hosting partner and not with any other external providers. We are processing your data exclusively on the basis of the legal provisions (GDPR, TKG 2003).

Contacting us  
If you are contacting us via email, the data you provide will be stored for six months in order to process your request and in case of follow-up questions. We will not pass on this data without your consent.

Cookies  
Cookies are üí©. (We are talking about the digital ones. The cookie-y ones are great!) So we don't use any here. Maybe this is an old-fashioned way of running things, but we don't want to make money with your data.

We have integrated a social sharing button. This uses the sharing functionality of your browser. So here's no shannanigans involved as well.

Web analytics  
This website uses Matomo as a tracking tool. However, only in the most basic way, without usage of cookies. We are just curious how many site visitors we are having.

Your IP address is recorded but immediately pseudonymized (e.g. by deleting the last 8 bits). This means, only a rough localization is possible.

Data processing is carried out on the basis of the legal provisions of Section 96 Paragraph 3 TKG and Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit a (consent) and/or f (legitimate interest) of the GDPR.

Because your privacy is extremely important to us, your user data is pseudonymized.

User data is getting stored for a maximum of 26 months.

We are linking to some music providers here. Of course their data protection guidelines are applying there.

Your rights  
You have the rights to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, revocation and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Germany, these are the respective state data protection officers.

You can reach us using the following contact details:
