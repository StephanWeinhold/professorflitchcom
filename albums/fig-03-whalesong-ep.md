Written and recorded in winter and spring 2022.

Layers of Blue is about the depths of the ocean.
Crananaberries is the usual dada-title. A combination of bananas and cranberries.
Ocean Foam is about sailing across the open sea and feeling free.
A Single Ray of Light is about, well, that single ray of light that makes it to the bottom of the sea. A tiny bit of hope in desperate times.
