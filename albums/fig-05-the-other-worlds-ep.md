Written and recorded between fall 2023 and mid 2024, mixed and mastered in summer 2024.

Traversing From A To B is about.. well, traversing from one point to the other. Kind of entering one of those other worlds that our imagination builds around us. Or used to build, when we were kids. Or where the worlds always there?

Dance of Those Little Fairies You Can Find At Dawn In The Back Of Your Garden is happening in one of those worlds. Actually the one we are fondest of.

Return To Sky City takes us back to that moment when we first discovered that city high above our heads.

Urban Doom Loop is a song about our future.
