Written and recorded during August and September 2023.

Seven is called Seven, because it is the opener of Figure Eight. No deeper meaning behind that.
The name Gnusasam fits the TCG-theme of the cover. It is about looking cute while being a fighter.
Assumption was written on August 8th. It mainly is about rising beyond being mortal.
Coming Home is about the transition of our mind - again the main picture is the journey from mortal being to something bigger.
